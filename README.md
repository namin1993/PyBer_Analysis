##  Summary

### Reccomendations for addressing disparities

The three business recommendations to address for disparities in the total city fares among the city types are:

    1.) Decrease the average fare per ride by a certain margin for rural and suburban cities in order to increase more total rides in both city types.

    2.) Offer monetary perks to new drivers in Rural or Suburban cities in order to increase the number of drivers using the app.

    3.) Increase more advertising in rural and suburban cities through popular media such as tv, radio, newspapers, and popular websites visited. Possibly team up with certain vendors in suburban or rural locations in order to promote workplace carpooling, delivery services, or improved shipping logistics.
